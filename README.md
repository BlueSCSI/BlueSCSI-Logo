## Usage
The BlueSCSI logo available as "open source" and is available for all non-retail and non-commercial usages. The design is optimized for smaller print (e.g., circuit boards). It is not necessary to retain the white stroke around the black text when the logo is the only visual item.

The white stroke around the black text should be used to visually seperate the BlueSCSI logo when it is present with other visual designs.
