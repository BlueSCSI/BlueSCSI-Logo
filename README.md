## Usage
The BlueSCSI logo available as "open source" and is available for all non-retail and non-commercial use. The design is optimized for smaller print (e.g., circuit boards).
 - It is not necessary to retain the white stroke around the black text when the logo is the only visual item.
 - The white stroke around the black text should be used to visually seperate the BlueSCSI logo when it is present with other visual designs.
